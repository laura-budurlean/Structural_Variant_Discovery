# Structural Variant Detection Pipeline Combining Optical Genome Mapping and Whole Genome Sequencing
by Laura Budurlean

A combination of optical genome mapping with Bionano and whole genome sequencing short-read data. This pipeline was created to help integrate structural variant calling from these two technologies. These results were published in:
